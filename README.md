# NLP Abstract Matching
Matches researchers with interesting papers using topic modeling. 

The current implementation is used to assist editors of peer-reviewed journals with the process of reviewing submitted manuscripts and assigning them to referees.  The script applies Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) to a sample of abstracts and uses cosine similarity to match the abstract of a submitted manuscript to a researcher who's work covers similar topics.  Finally, the script assigns each paper to one editor and suggests a number of potential assistant editors and referees.  

### Future Improvements
I plan to extend the code to work with different topic models and provide more command line options.
